Static vs. Interactive Visualizations:
Static visualizations (like Matplotlib charts) are great for quick reporting and simple 
storytelling. They are fast to generate, easy to save as images, and work well in documents 
or presentations. The downside is that the viewer cannot explore the data beyond what is 
shown. Interactive visualizations (like Plotly) allow zooming, panning, hovering for exact 
values, and filtering. This makes it easier to explore patterns, outliers, and details 
without creating many separate charts.

Advantages of dashboards for real-time data exploration:
Dashboards combine multiple views of the same dataset and let users interact with the data 
through controls such as dropdowns, sliders, and buttons. This is useful for real-time 
exploration because the same dashboard can answer many questions quickly (for example, 
changing a country in a dropdown immediately updates the chart). Dashboards help teams 
monitor KPIs, spot trends early, and make decisions faster without needing a new report 
every time.

How Plotly and Dash improve data communication:
Plotly and Dash improve communication by making charts more engaging and more precise. 
Hover tooltips show exact values, interactive legends help compare categories, and users 
can focus on the part of the data that matters (zooming into a specific time period, 
selecting a specific country, etc.). In professional settings this reduces misunderstandings,
supports data-driven decisions, and allows non-technical stakeholders to explore insights 
on their own through a web app.
